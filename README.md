# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project - Election Audit
I was requested by Tom, a Board of Elections employee to assist with the election audit of the tabulated results for the U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado. The task was to report the total number of votes casted, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. Tomâ€™s boss is looking to see if it can be coded in python and if successful, this will be used not only for congressional districts but also senatorial districts and local elections. There are three primary voting methods that will be taken into account: mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic (DRE) counting machines. Once counted, my task was to generate a vote count report to certify this U.S congressional race. I submitted the audit results, and the election commission requested some additional data to complete the audit.


### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver the results. The requested deliverables to be provided to the election commission are:

- [x] Deliverable 1: The election results printed to the command line
- [x] Deliverable 2: The election results saved to a text file
- [x] Deliverable 3: Written analysis of the election audit

## Election-Audit Results
Below are the results based on the questions provided by the election commission:

    Diana DeGette won with 272,892 votes which represted 73.8% of the total votes. 

### Election-Audit Summary
The quickest benchmark to compare if the refactoring reduced the execution times, is by comparing the run times between the codes. Below is a comparison of the 2017 pre and post refactoring run times. The pre time shows that the code ran in 1.15 seconds while the post time shows that the code ran in 0.13 seconds. The difference of 1.02 seconds which is almost 89% less run time.
